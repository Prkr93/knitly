# Knitly

Do you like knitting and want to make your own pattern charts? Do you appreciate symmetry, but are frustrated with the tediousness of making a perfect chart? Knitly might be for you.

Create your own knitting chart using this app. Toggle through different stitch and color options, and even enable mirror mode to create a symmetrical pattern with ease!

Can't think of anything or would like to save your patterns? Install the knitly-server and view any of your saved patterns, or submitted patterns, at any time!
