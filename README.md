## Goals

- Develop an app serving a niche audience that solves a problem specific to them.
- Display and manipulate data from an API, and have multiple views with Router.


## Celebrations & Wins

- Built my own Express server for the first time, in order to utilize Fetch API.
- Was able to implement a nested state data structure using Map objects in order to directly iterate through the entire pattern and minimize async functionality of setState.
- Bare-bones app - only asset imported is a google font, all icons are plain CSS, no extra packages used or dependencies needed.
- Finally brought this long-standing idea to fruition!
