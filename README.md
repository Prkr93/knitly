# Knitly

Do you like knitting and want to make your own pattern charts? Do you appreciate symmetry, but are frustrated with the tediousness of making a perfect chart? Knitly might be for you!

Create your own knitting chart with ease using this app. Toggle through different stitch and color options, and even enable mirror mode to create a symmetrical pattern in half the clicks!

## Goals

- Develop an app serving a niche audience that solves a problem specific to them.
- Display and manipulate data from an API, and have multiple views with Router.


## Celebrations & Wins

- Built my own Express server for the first time, in order to utilize Fetch API.
- Was able to implement a nested state data structure using Map objects in order to directly iterate through the entire pattern and minimize async functionality of setState.
- Bare-bones app - only asset imported is a google font, all icons are plain CSS, no extra packages used or dependencies needed.
- Finally brought this long-standing idea to fruition!
